# PopGen :boom:
This repository contains a master script/ code for performing **Population Genetics Analysis** e.g. for *Plasmodium falciparum*!
Let's start by making a repository containing all of the code, packages and software we will need for the analysis...
```
conda create -n pop_gen
conda activate pop_gen
## Lot's of installations...


```



Going to use fastq2 matrix to get matrix and also do maf filtering first....
